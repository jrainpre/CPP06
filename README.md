<h1>C++ Module 06 - C++ Casts</h1>
<p>Welcome to the repository for C++ Module 06. Dive deep into the world of C++ casting mechanisms.</p>


</div>

## ðŸ“œ Introduction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". This module is designed in accordance with the C++98 standard, focusing on various exercises involving C++ casting mechanisms.

## ðŸ“Œ Exercises

### Exercise 00: Conversion of scalar types
<ul>
    <li><strong>ScalarConverter Class</strong>: Convert C++ literals to scalar types like char, int, float, and double.</li>
    <li><strong>Type Handling</strong>: Manage pseudo literals such as -inff, +inff, nanf, -inf, +inf, and nan.</li>
</ul>

### Exercise 01: Serialization
<ul>
    <li><strong>Serializer Class</strong>: Convert pointers to unsigned integers and vice versa.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Handling</strong>: Work with a non-empty Data structure and manage serialization and deserialization.</li>
</ul>

### Exercise 02: Identify real type
<ul>
    <li><strong>Base Class</strong>: Create a class structure with A, B, and C inheriting from Base.</li>
    <li><strong>Type Identification</strong>: Determine the actual type of an object without using the typeinfo header.</li>
</ul>

## ðŸš€ Compilation & Usage
Ensure you're on a system with a C++ compiler.

### Compilation
Compile the exercises with the provided Makefile.
```bash
make
```

### Execution
Execute the desired exercise. For example:
```bash
./conversion input.txt
```
